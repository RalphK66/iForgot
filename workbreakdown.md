### Tasks Worked On

**Task Name**:  Project files

Explanation:

	o	I used the figma prototypes to create html mock ups of a login page, a main page, a create page, a edit page and a single-reminder page. 

	o	I managed to style these pages so that they are the same as the prototype images
	o	Added some js to dynamically create list items for the subtasks

	o	These list items can added, removed, edited, marked as complete and deleted

**Task Name**:  Project Files – Take two

Explanation:

	o	I have attempted to integrate my project files from above with Armaan’s example reminderapp which he provided

	o	I reverse engineered some of his features and then added some of my html and js to them from my original project files

	o	Currently I have the all-reminders page kind of working

	o	I also have the create new reminder page kind of working

	o	The landing page is also set as my localhost/3000 page.

**Task Name**:  

Explanation:

	o	I attempted to set up a database with Firebase

	o	I also attempted to set up a database with MongoDB – I installed compass locally and got a project going, but struggled through some tutorials that assume you have prior knowledge, so really had a hard time figuring it out.

	o	I feel with a little more instruction or a tutorial video specifically about databases, I may have succeeded, but my conceptual understanding of how it works is just not there.

	o	I will continue to try.

	o	In the meantime I am using the fake “cindy” database

	o	I changed it from Armaan’s original reminderapp example to an object which contains a title, a datetime and subtasks

**Task Name**:  Datetimepicker

Explanation:

	o	I used a combination of css, javascript and html to create a datetimepicker

	o	This took me ages to accomplish and I am still struggling to fix some of the styling.

	o	It works great though.

	o	I am still to figure how to use the data to present the reminders in various ways:

			Reminders in order chronological order

			All reminders for one day

			All reminders for a week 

			All reminders for a month	

**Task Name**:  Weather API

Explanation:

	o	I could not get an apikey for darksky, so chose to use openweathermap instead

	o	I used geocoder and google api’s to get the users location from their ip address, and then query the weather api with that information, but couldn’t get it work

	o	I think with more time I could make that happen though

**Side Note** 
I would like to add, that I have been having a good time trying to figure this out, and I will make my own working version of this this summer, as I have already spent an inordinate amount of time on it, it wouldn’t make sense to stop now. I have some cool design ideas for
